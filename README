## Build Instructions

Use `cabal` to build the word frequency histogram generator from the source directory:
    
    $ cabal configure
    $ cabal build
    
This builds the executable `hist` into the dist directory. You should be able to run
    
    $ dist/build//hist [text-file]
    
You can also install the binary by running:
    
    $ cabal install
